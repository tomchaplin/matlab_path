# matlab_path

A collection of useful MATLAB functions and scripts that I like to have on my path.

* `ifig` - a script for writing a figure to file (eps/png) in an interactive manner
* `persForLoop` - a function for writing nested for loop which save state on each iterations of the loop
* `persForLoopSplitSaves` - as above but output of each iteration is saved as a separate file and combined later
